@JuriaTRM you can't just treat it by talking or thinking, because that is not where emotions come from
@JuriaTRM emotional disorders are especially hard to deal with precisely bc there is no rational basis to emotions even without disorder
But don't think poorly of yourself just because can't help feeling a certain way. You can't control that, but you can control your actions.
None of this means that you should stop reasoning and act on your gut feelings. They are nothing more than ancient, vague approximations.
So for your survival emotions must be strong enough that you won't question them, or feel that they aren't irrational.
But they are.
If you ignore something that was passed on by your ancestors through your DNA, there is a good probability that you will die.
there is a risk that you will stop and think about it and discover that there is no available explanation to your gut feeling, &amp; ignore it.
Emotions are a way to inform you about innate knowledge, or more exactly what passes for knowledge. If they aren't compelling enough,
The fact that you can't control your feelings isn't a bug, it's a feature. They are designed to hijack your reasoning abilities.

@salahmaker but why would people want to be reprogrammed? They're attracted to whomever, it's a personal characteristic I guess
RT @HotondoGaijin: @cyber_octopus It’s also true for JP living abroad. There are words for JP-FR couples. 日男仏女 and 日女仏男. The former one is…
@cyber_octopus so, hum, go to a ton of parties and flirt aggressively with everything that moves and if you're very lucky, who knows...
Asian-looking girls were at the top for all white/asian-looking/black guys, followed by white girls, and at bottom were black girls.
Anyway, yeah, I don't have any advice to lonely white women in Japan. There was that charts about attractiveness of different people
@cyber_octopus (+ I know nothing about "the dating scene" in France either so I can't say Japan is more this and that)
(reasons why I can't relate to the story: I am not an attractive white woman who goes to dance clubs and knows how to flirt XD)
.@HotondoGaijin Not being judgemental here, just saying I don't have a hard time believing the story in that link
.@HotondoGaijin I see dozens of white men with Japanese women (with kids or just dating) but I only ever saw I white woman w/ a JP guy
For a billion reasons I can't really relate to this story, but I sure as heck noticed that there's a double standard https://t.co/P4jlpuQKZY

Goodnight!
@Absurdum14 talking about words you know you should be careful with.
@Absurdum14 well, this conversation started by me saying I don't feel like using boku bc I don't know when it's appropriate, so I am
@Absurdum14 "native speakers included", as I said just abovev:)
@Absurdum14 I know which Japanese words I'm willing to think twice about before using them :)
@Absurdum14 that's why I said "people with a good command of the language". They know what risk they want or don't want to take, just like
@Absurdum14 because I dislike needlessly vulgar people? Native speakers included.
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley you as such.
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley my opinion on this is that if you think you mastered the language enough to use slang without risks, I'll treat
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley being a foreigner doesn't mean that I have to give up on really learning the language ;)
I like progressing.
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley bc unlike beginners, it's difficult to guess whether they don't realise what they are saying or just don't care.
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley actually foreigners who have a good command of French but use slang in inappropriate ways make me ill at ease
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley don't have any interest in dumbing it down... I don't want the gaikokujin treatment. At. All. :p
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley but I don't want that :)
My spoken Japanese is good enough that I don't get the "aww foreigner" treatment, and I
@Absurdum14 @glen_malley hmm... for some reason the perspective doesn't appeal to me.I wouldn't want to talk like a young jp girl either tbh
@glen_malley If it's how you feel comfortable there's no problem w/ this! But if you actually wish to speak more but don't/can't that's a pb
@glen_malley that is the only way I ever learned any language. I don't crave using boku to the point of ignoring all possible misuses :)
@glen_malley I don't feel like I can use boku, bc I have never heard any woman use it, so I don't have any feeling of when it's appropriate
@glen_malley hear someone talking and just learn from them how I should talk.
@glen_malley I think I lack people to take example of. There are only guys in my lab, &amp; my lady friends are much older than me. So I can't
@glen_malley ah, I see. As a woman I don't really have pronouns to choose from. It's just watashi &amp; omitting it altogether is more natural
