Stages
1: prediction
2: Snap
3: Space Patterns
4: Time Patterns

Hierarchy, top down search, rely on predictions, mute, STM>1, continuous (non binary, not layered) stimulation


TODO
update bundles when snapping
how to count weights?
how to write weights? sep direct, bundles and probazs
to activate pattern neurons we might need too many pass of “doDirect activation” so we really need deysnc activation w/o special treatment for “direct weights”.
give priority to pattern neurons over patterned neurons (but when of we don’t have direct weights??)
silenced neurons: can function but cannot get into stm
all neurons with a directoutweight are silent


We don’t actually need instantaneous weights — complete parallelism is more important than instant reaction times


when we have space, we can avoid too big search in snap statement.
also higher levels should get closer and closer to each other while sensory levels are separated: sensory out surface of brain, high level inside with trunk linking hemispheres??

snap: outweights globally the same, inweights individually not contradicting.
