Stages
1: prediction
2: Snap
3: Space Patterns
4: actions
5: attention and wrong predictions
6: Time Patterns

top down search, rely on predictions, mute, STM>1, continuous (non binary, not layered) stimulation


TODO
prediction map bug
try it w/ simple case
1) becomes gray
2) becomes permanent
3) reduced to 1 px
4) stops being updated	

weight count
bundle weights minimization (take the smaller?bigger? of two sets if one is included in the other?)
dream
noise


start with really 0 neurons;
sync of direct activations: how

to activate pattern neurons we might need too many pass of “doDirect activation” so we really need deysnc activation w/o special treatment for “direct weights”.

with attention we can avoid trying to predict each neuron...

We don’t actually need instantaneous weights — complete parallelism is more important than instant reaction times


when we have space, we can avoid too big search in snap statement.
also higher levels should get closer and closer to each other while sensory levels are separated: sensory out surface of brain, high level inside with trunk linking hemispheres??

snap: outweights globally the same, inweights individually not contradicting.
