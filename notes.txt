Stages
1: prediction
2: Snap
3: Space Patterns
4: Time Patterns

Hierarchy, top down search, rely on predictions, mute, STM>1, continuous (non binary, not layered) stimulation

TODO
What if there already is a same pattern Neuron? Don’t add it twice
give priority to pattern neurons over patterned neurons
We don’t actually need instantaneous weights — complete parallelism is more important than instant reaction times


when we have space, we can avoid too big search in snap statement.
also higher levels should get closer and closer to each other while sensory levels are separated: sensory out surface of brain, high level inside with trunk linking hemispheres??

snap: outweights globally the same, inweights individually not contradicting.
